# face-detection
Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc.. Today we will be using the face classifier. You can experiment with other classifiers as well.
>Face detection is a non-trivial computer vision problem for identifying and localizing faces in images.
>Face detection can be performed using the classical feature-based cascade classifier using the OpenCV library.
>State-of-the-art face detection can be achieved using a Multi-task Cascade CNN via the MTCNN library.
